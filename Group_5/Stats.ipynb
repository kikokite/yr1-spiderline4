    "#### It seems like there's a trend where Negamax and Minimax tends to perform well against the other algorithms, while Monte Carlo Tree Search also show competitive performance in certain matchups. A* seems to be less effective compared to the other algorithms based on these tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A* vs. A*:\n",
    "\n",
    "Since both instances of A* algorithm are identical, they exhibit the same behavior and performance. Therefore, they win an equal number of times, demonstrating consistency and reliability in their performance. It's also possible to stem that the algorithm who starts will be the one who wins (in their first 4 moves)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A* vs. Minimax:\n",
    "\n",
    "Minimax typically outperforms A* due to its ability to perform an exhaustive search of the game tree, which allows it to make optimal decisions based on perfect information. A*, on the other hand, might not explore the game tree as deeply or efficiently, leading to suboptimal decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A* vs. Monte Carlo Tree Search:\n",
    "\n",
    "Monte Carlo Tree Search often wins more frequently over A* because it combines random simulation with strategic selection and expansion of game tree nodes. This allows it to explore the game tree more effectively and find better moves compared to A*, which might rely more on heuristics or limited search.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. A* vs. Negamax:\n",
    "\n",
    "Negamax consistently outperforms A* because it is specifically designed for adversarial search problems like the one presented in the game. Negamax employs alpha-beta pruning and a heuristic evaluation function to efficiently search the game tree and make optimal decisions, giving it an edge over A*.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Minimax vs. Minimax:\n",
    "\n",
    "Both Minimax algorithms perform equally well against each other because they use the same algorithmic approach and evaluation function. Therefore, they make similar decisions in the game, resulting in an equal number of wins for each instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Minimax vs. Monte Carlo Tree Search:\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the expectation that Monte Carlo Tree Search might have an advantage due to its ability to balance exploration and exploitation, it's important to recognize that the performance of these algorithms can vary based on factors such as the specific game dynamics, the quality of the heuristic evaluation function, and the depth of the search tree.\n",
    "In this particular scenario, Minimax won more games against Monte Carlo Tree Search, indicating that in the context of this game and its parameters, Minimax was able to find better moves more consistently than Monte Carlo Tree Search.\n",
    "Possible reasons for Minimax's success could include a more effective evaluation function, a deeper search depth, or a better understanding of the game dynamics, allowing it to make more informed decisions compared to Monte Carlo Tree Search.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Minimax vs. Negamax:\n",
    "\n",
    "This suggests that both algorithms are equally effective in this particular game scenario. However, it's essential to consider other factors such as computational resources, time complexity, and ease of implementation when choosing between the two algorithms. Negamax's simplification of the Minimax algorithm and its use of alpha-beta pruning make it an attractive choice for many scenarios, but Minimax might still have its advantages in certain contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Monte Carlo Tree Search vs. Monte Carlo Tree Search:\n",
    "\n",
    "Both instances of Monte Carlo Tree Search perform equally well against each other because they use the same algorithmic approach and parameters. Therefore, they exhibit similar behavior and performance in the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Monte Carlo Tree Search vs. Negamax:\n",
    "\n",
    "Negamax consistently wins over Monte Carlo Tree Search due to its more systematic and efficient search of the game tree. While Monte Carlo Tree Search relies on random simulations, Negamax uses alpha-beta pruning and heuristic evaluation to make more informed decisions, giving it an advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Negamax vs. Negamax:\n",
    "\n",
    "Both instances of Negamax perform equally well against each other because they use the same algorithmic approach and parameters. Therefore, they exhibit similar behavior and performance in the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In summary, the performance differences between the algorithms stem from variations in their search strategies, evaluation functions, and efficiency in exploring the game tree. Algorithms like Negamax and Monte Carlo Tree Search tend to outperform others due to their ability to efficiently search deeper into the game tree and make better decisions based on the available information.\n",
